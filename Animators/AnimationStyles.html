		<p><h4><b></b></h4></p>
		<p>Though by no means as comprehensive overview, here's a few types or styles of animation that I know of.</p>

		<article class="aniProfile">
		<p><h4><b>2d Cell/Hand-Drawn/Traditional Animation</b></h4></p>
		<p>Before computers got advanced enough to be capable of rendering meaningful graphics, most animation was done by this very labor and time intensive method of <b>Traditional Hand-Drawn, Cell-Based Animation</b> which it's name from the transparent plastic sheets called <i>Cells</i> on which individual frames of animation were drawn.</p>
		<p>This method of animation was very expensive, and very labor intensive, so much so that tradition 2d animation studios developed a number of sophisticated (and not so sophisticated **cough**<i>Funmation</i>**cough**) methods for

		<article class="aniProfile">
		<h4><b>Stop Motion</b></h4></p></b>
		<p>An Animation Style that often relies on physical 3d objects being moved in between individual shots with a camera, stop-motion animation goes back to the dawn of motion pictures</p>
		<p>examples of this include many of the early animations by <i>Aardman</i> studio (<i>Wallace and Grommit</i>, <i>Chicken Run</i>, etc.); as well as american works like Gumby and even the first few seasons of <i>South-Park</i> (which used actual pieces of construction-paper rather than drawn illustrations)</p>
		</article>
		<article class="aniProfile">
		<p><h4><b>2d Computer-Animation</b></h4></p></b>
		<p>Though 2d Animation Using Computers had existed for quite some time, and was certainly used in enhancing/easing up some of the pipeline for theatrical and television animation, I think 2d CGI Animation really got started in the later 1990's or early 2000's.</p>
		<p>I say this in part because, from my recollection; that's when Shockwave and later Flash were created and first marketed.</p>
		<p>Though supposedly obsolete by today's standards, Shockwave/Flash played a significant role in pioneering and highlighting some of the basic advantages of 2d animation, notably the ease that comes when using vectors over bitmaps.</p>
		<p>The Use of Vectors, and the ease that they present can be explained as such: if at frame-1 a circle is at coordinates (0,0), and at frame-5, the circle is at coordinates(10,10),(both frame 1 and frame 5 representing what are called <b>keyframes</b>) you don't necesarily need to have people drawing frames 2-4.</p>
		<p> likewise consider that this goes for rotation, and furthermore realize the savings from not requiring the amount of resources (pencils, ink/brushes, clear cell sheets, xenography machines, etc)

		<article class="aniProfile">
		<p><h4><b>3d CGI</b></h4></p>
		<p> Computer Generated 3d animation, at least as far as the entertainment industry is concerned, first saw widespread use as a means by which to augment or enhance more traditional methods of animation, with films such as Walt Disney's <i><a href="https://youtu.be/FLjj0SJTuSM">"The Great Mouse Detective"</a></i>(1986) 
		using 3d animation in the clocktower chase sequence, or live action films such as <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/how-the-jurassic-park-dinosaurs-switched-from-stop-motion-to-cgi-100955.html"><i>Jurrassic Park</i></a> or <i>Tron</i> using CGI to help enhance and complement a combination of stop motion figures, live actors, and animatronics.</p>
